# Flx Chatbot

![Chatbot Preview](./src/images/chatbot.png)

This project features a chatbot implemented in an ElevenLabs website. The front-end code for the ElevenLabs website has been created using website cloning techniques. However, the chatbot component, a core feature of this project, has been fully developed by me(Flenex.io) using a React library called react-simple-chatbot. This is just a initial state of the project and many more features will be adding soon.

## Project Overview

The primary purpose of this chatbot is to facilitate interactions between users and the website, serving as a query assistant. When visitors have questions or require specific information while exploring the website, they can engage with the chatbot to obtain the answers they seek.

1. Visit the live project where the chatbot is implemented.

2. The chatbot should be prominently displayed on bottom right side of the website, ready to assist you with any questions or information you need.
